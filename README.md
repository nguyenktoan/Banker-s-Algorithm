# Banker's Algorithm

## Description
This project implements the **Banker's Algorithm**, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in multi-process systems. The algorithm helps to avoid deadlock by determining whether a process can be safely allocated resources without causing deadlock.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction and testing of the algorithm.
- Input fields for the number of processes and resources.
- Calculation of resource allocation safety using the Banker's Algorithm.
- Display of results and system state.
